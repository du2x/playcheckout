## Decisions

### AD-001
- **Decision**: The server is a single Fastify process that hosts Colyseus on one port — static client and WebSocket endpoint share `app.server` via the `colyseus/vite` wiring: `new WebSocketTransport({ noServer: true })` + `transport.attachToServer(app.server)` + `createNodeMatchmakingMiddleware()` mounted on Fastify's request chain.
- **Reason**: prd §11 locks single-container deploy (Railway). The `{ server: fastify.server }` transport option would register its express app as a competing `request` listener; the noServer+attachToServer pattern is Colyseus' own documented shared-HTTP-server mechanism (verified in 0.18.3 sources), with upgrade-only overlap and no request-flow conflict.
- **Trade-off**: We own an integration no public Fastify reference covers (first to publish it); separate-port dev setups would be simpler to debug but break the deploy contract.
- **Scope**: `apps/server`, all future rooms, CI smoke/boot tests.

### AD-002
- **Decision**: Room owns the lobby, sim owns the round. The Colyseus room (`TurnoverRoom`) manages roster, names, host, join/reject rules, and phase transitions; the pure sim (`RoundSim`) is created fresh at host-start with `(seed, playerIds)`, ticks 20 Hz, and dies at the buzzer. Lobby churn never enters the sim.
- **Reason**: Join/leave/name validation is transport-shaped; keeping it out of `packages/sim` keeps the deterministic core minimal, and every later Phase 2 cycle (2.2–2.6) extends only `RoundSim`.
- **Trade-off**: Two state homes (room phase + sim clock) with a sync point at start/buzzer — accepted; the seam is exactly two transitions, both gate-tested.
- **Scope**: All Phase 2 cycles, `packages/sim`, `apps/server/src/rooms`.

- **Status**: active

### AD-003
- **Decision**: Insert cycle 2.2 `first-light` before `movement`: a minimal client
  slice (join-by-code screen, roster, host-start, labeled rectangles + round clock
  once the sim starts) consuming only messages already in the T3 catalog. Cycles
  shift: movement → 2.3, work-channels → 2.4, evidence → 2.5, justice → 2.6,
  round-end → 2.7, telemetry → 2.8.
- **Reason**: Nothing is visually verifiable until Phase 3, so Gate 3 has nothing
  honest to assert; more importantly the Fastify+Colyseus wiring (AD-001) has no
  public reference and was only proven by a boot smoke test. A thin browser slice
  proves the riskiest integration before six cycles pile onto it, and gives later
  cycles real `client:*` gate scenarios.
- **Trade-off**: Pulls ~15% of Phase 3 forward; Phase 3 proper (movement rendering,
  work channels, evidence cues) stays put. Protocol risk is nil — only existing
  catalog messages are consumed, roles never render (protocol rule enforced early).
- **Scope**: `apps/client`, `.specs/features/first-light/`, roadmap.md cycle table.

## Handoff

- **Feature**: room-shell (`.specs/features/room-shell/`) — all 7 tasks committed (T1-T7)
- **Phase / Task**: Validated (validation.md PASS, validate_state exit 0); all 7 tasks committed
- **Completed**: sim deal (T1), RoundSim + sim:role_deal (T2), message catalog (T3),
  lobby join (T4), start/sim/routing (T5), churn (T6), registration swap + full round (T7)
- **In-progress** (file:line): none
- **Next step**: cycle 2.2 `first-light` — fresh Specify for
  `.specs/features/first-light/` (AD-003)
- **Blockers**: none
- **Uncommitted files**: none
- **Branch**: master

Deferred notes from Verifier (PASS, low-severity spec-precision gaps): (1) LOBBY-02
"create no room" clause unasserted; (2) rejected start intent lacks a lobby-phase
re-assertion (reject-then-start mutant); (3) LOBBY-05 "roster unchanged" after name
rejection unasserted — fold into the next cycle touching TurnoverRoom.
