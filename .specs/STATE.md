## Decisions

### AD-001
- **Decision**: The server is a single Fastify process that hosts Colyseus on one port — static client and WebSocket endpoint share `app.server` via the `colyseus/vite` wiring: `new WebSocketTransport({ noServer: true })` + `transport.attachToServer(app.server)` + `createNodeMatchmakingMiddleware()` mounted on Fastify's request chain.
- **Reason**: prd §11 locks single-container deploy (Railway). The `{ server: fastify.server }` transport option would register its express app as a competing `request` listener; the noServer+attachToServer pattern is Colyseus' own documented shared-HTTP-server mechanism (verified in 0.18.3 sources), with upgrade-only overlap and no request-flow conflict.
- **Trade-off**: We own an integration no public Fastify reference covers (first to publish it); separate-port dev setups would be simpler to debug but break the deploy contract.
- **Scope**: `apps/server`, all future rooms, CI smoke/boot tests.

### AD-002
- **Decision**: Room owns the lobby, sim owns the round. The Colyseus room (`TurnoverRoom`) manages roster, names, host, join/reject rules, and phase transitions; the pure sim (`RoundSim`) is created fresh at host-start with `(seed, playerIds)`, ticks 20 Hz, and dies at the buzzer. Lobby churn never enters the sim.
- **Reason**: Join/leave/name validation is transport-shaped; keeping it out of `packages/sim` keeps the deterministic core minimal, and every later Phase 2 cycle (2.2–2.6) extends only `RoundSim`.
- **Trade-off**: Two state homes (room phase + sim clock) with a sync point at start/buzzer — accepted; the seam is exactly two transitions, both gate-tested.
- **Scope**: All Phase 2 cycles, `packages/sim`, `apps/server/src/rooms`.
- **Date**: 2026-08-27
- **Status**: active

### AD-003
- **Decision**: Insert cycle 2.2 `first-light` before `movement`: a minimal client
  slice (join-by-code screen, roster, host-start, labeled rectangles + round clock
  once the sim starts) consuming only messages already in the T3 catalog. Cycles
  shift: movement → 2.3, work-channels → 2.4, evidence → 2.5, justice → 2.6,
  round-end → 2.7, telemetry → 2.8.
- **Reason**: Nothing is visually verifiable until Phase 3, so Gate 3 has nothing
  honest to assert; more importantly the Fastify+Colyseus wiring (AD-001) has no
  public reference and was only proven by a boot smoke test. A thin browser slice
  proves the riskiest integration before six cycles pile onto it, and gives later
  cycles real `client:*` gate scenarios.
- **Trade-off**: Pulls ~15% of Phase 3 forward; Phase 3 proper (movement rendering,
  work channels, evidence cues) stays put. Protocol risk is nil — only existing
  catalog messages are consumed, roles never render (protocol rule enforced early).
- **Scope**: `apps/client`, `.specs/features/first-light/`, roadmap.md cycle table.

- **Status**: active

### AD-004
- **Decision**: Test-only shift-length seam. `RoundSim` accepts an optional
  `totalTicks` config (default unchanged: `TUNING.SHIFT_SECONDS × TICK_HZ`); the
  TurnoverRoom passes `TURNOVER_TEST_SHIFT_SECONDS` (seconds → ticks at 20 Hz)
  only when `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`. The gate-3 webServer boots the real
  server with `TURNOVER_TEST_SHIFT_SECONDS=8` so client scenarios reach a real
  buzzer in seconds (8 s leaves margin for the LIGHT-09 clock sampling that
  must finish before the buzzer; originally 5 s, widened for flake margin).
- **Reason**: LIGHT-13/14 (buzzer → lobby, re-deal) are untestable in a real
  browser against a 300 s wall-clock shift; every later Phase 2 cycle's
  `client:*` scenarios need fast rounds too.
- **Trade-off**: One optional sim parameter and two env reads — production code
  path is byte-identical to the §7 default; harness DOM clock (300 s) disagrees
  with the shortened server round, accepted as display-only until cycle 2.3
  introduces server time fields.
- **Scope**: `packages/sim/src/roundSim.ts`, `apps/server/src/rooms/TurnoverRoom.ts`,
  `apps/client/harness/playwright.config.ts`.

## Handoff

- **Feature**: first-light (`.specs/features/first-light/`) — all 7 tasks committed
- **Phase / Task**: Validated (validation.md PASS, validate_state exit 0); all 7 tasks committed
- **Completed**: sim shift seam + AD-004 (T1), view reducer (T2), join slice + harness
  client:lobby_join (T3), lobby coverage (T4), round view + client:round_start (T5),
  buzzer re-deal (T6), close-out sweep + room-full surfacing (T7)
- **In-progress** (file:line): none
- **Next step**: cycle 2.3 `movement` — fresh Specify for `.specs/features/movement/`;
  fold verifier gaps 2–4 (LIGHT-02 unknown-code message, LIGHT-08 "round already
  active", LIGHT-04 1-char name minimum) into the next client-touching cycle
- **Blockers**: none (Gate 4 human 5-min round pending — run `pnpm boot` or
  `pnpm build && node apps/server/dist/index.js`, open 4 tabs, create/join/start)
- **Uncommitted files**: user WIP `scripts/dev-boot.mjs` + `package.json` boot script
  (not part of this feature; dev-boot formatted for lint)
- **Branch**: master

Deferred notes from Verifier (room-shell PASS, low-severity spec-precision gaps):
(1) LOBBY-02 "create no room" clause unasserted; (2) rejected start intent lacks a
lobby-phase re-assertion (reject-then-start mutant); (3) LOBBY-05 "roster unchanged"
after name rejection unasserted — fold into the next cycle touching TurnoverRoom.
